# Combining Zettlekasten with Building a Second Brain

## Summary
This article discusses how to combine the [[Zettlekasten]] Method with *Building a Second Brain* method by [[Tiago Forte]]. [[Sascha Fast]] explains that the two methods can be combined "perfectly", as they are largely completely separate systems (and modular; see [[Modularity Principle]]).

Sascha summarizes *Building a Second Brain* as a system with the two key points:
1. [[Building a Second Brain is an information management system]]
2. [[Building a Second Brain is a project management system]]

Building a Second Brain is ultimately for people who suffer from cognitive overload. 

```ad-note
Sascha actually described it as information overload, but to me, it seems more generally to be cognitive overload.
```

Sascha describes two sources of (cognitive) overload and how they can be solved for via BASB:
1. [[Cognitive overload can come from Openness to Experience]] - "It allows managing information and resources with little effort."
2. [[Cognitive overload can come from Intellect]] - "It is explicitly project-oriented."

Key systems to using BASB:
[[PARA System]], [[CODE Workflow]], Weekly and Monthly Reviews.

```ad-question
Quarterly and Annual Reviews? See [[Replace resolutions with themes]].

```
 
Sascha then compares the two methods and uses the analogy that "BASB is a cat , ZKM is a dog", which is to say that the way in which these two methods interact with humans are completely different. 

PARA is a hierarchical folder systems which organizes information based on its importance and its urgency, while Zettlekasten is a "heterarchy of thoughts". PARA is always moving information around to where it needs to be.

```ad-note
I quite like the semi/un-structured nature of Zettlekasten over the production-line system of PARA. To me, ZKM is far more natural and I still am having a difficult time seeing how to fit PARA in to my life.

CODE is applicable though.
