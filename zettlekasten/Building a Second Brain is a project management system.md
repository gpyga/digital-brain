# Building a Second Brain is a project management system

```ad-quote
The emphasis of the whole system on action effectiveness is particularly evident through the filing system PARA. The four parts (**P**rojects, **A**reas, **R**resources, **A**rchive) are aligned to a hierarchy of urgency. At the same time, a connection is made between urgency and importance because completed projects are “the blood flow of your Second Brain.” Importance and urgency are the categories of projects and tasks. In a sense, the overall system speaks the “language of action”.

In contrast, the Zettelkasten Method speaks the “language of knowledge”. In the Zettelkasten, there is no such thing as importance or urgency. Each note merely contains ideas and their connections to other ideas. Their actionability is a second layer that we put onto them.
