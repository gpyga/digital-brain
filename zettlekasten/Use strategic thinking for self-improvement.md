# Use strategic thinking for self-improvement

Corporate strategy is "an integrated set of positions that a firm to win", but the goal in life is not winning, the goal is to live a good life.

Seven questions for corporate strategy
1. How does the organization define success?
2. What is our purpose?
3. What is our vision?
4. How do we assess our business portfolio?
5. What can we learn from benchmarks?
6. What portfolio choices should we make?
7. How can the organization ensure successful, sustained change?

Similarly, for a person's life-strategy:
1. How do I define a great life?
2. What is my life purpose?
3. What is my life vision?
4. How do I assess my life portfolio?
5. What can I learn from benchmarks?
6. What portfolio choices can I make?
7. How can I ensure successful, sustained life change?

### How to define a great life
PERMA, which has since been updated to PERMA-V, comes from [[Positive Psychology]], developed by [[Martin Seligman]].

**(P)** Positive Emotions - the amount and frequency of contentment in my life
**(E)** Engagements - Flow state, losing track of time, am I enjoying what I am doing?
**(R)** Relationships - quality of partnerships, friendships, colleagues, mutual feelings of love
**(M)** Meaning - is my effort something that is meaningful to me? Am I making the world a better place?
**(A)** Achievement - Am I reaching goals that are challenging? Am I reaching mastery?
**(V)** Vitality - am I healthy and energetic?

```ad-note
This seems awfully similar to [[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]].
```

```ad-quote
To determine what makes a great life for you, start with each element in PERMA-V, or even add your own categories, such as autonomy or spirituality. Then rate each oneâ€™s importance to you on a scale from 0 (not important) to 10 (very important). Try to recall periods of deep satisfaction in your past and consider what triggered them.

### Life Portfolio 
Define Strategic Life Units (SLUs) which can be invested in with time, energy and money. 

There are 16 SLUs which can be bundled into 6 Strategic Life Areas (SLAs)
**1. Relationships**
1. Significant Other
2. Family
3. Friends
**2. Body, mind, spirit**
1. Physical Health
2. Mental Health
3. Spirituality/Faith
**3. Community and Society**
1. Community/Citizenship
2. Societal Engagement
**4. Job, Learning and Finances**
1. Career
2. Education
3. Finances
**5. Interests and Entertainment**
1. Hobbies/interests
2. Online Entertainment
3. Offline Entertainment
**6. Personal Care**
1. Physiological Needs
2. [[Activities of daily living]]

To assess our "life portfolio", divide an average week from the year across the 16 SLUs (ie - 40 hours of work, 60 hours of sleep, 20 hours of television/online entertainment, etc). Then, rate the importance of each SLU and rate the level of satisfaction for each SLU. The result will be a 2x2 similar to the [[BCG Portfolio Matrix]] with the importance on the y-axis and the satisfaction on the x-axis and the size of the bubble represents the time allocation.

All three of these dimensions (satisfaction, importance and time commitment) are all under your control - though importance is likely slowly moving. The goal is to shift as many of the largest bubbles into the top-right as possible. That may mean spending more time on things that have high satisfaction and high importance or moving things which are high importance on the satisfaction scale. 

### Benchmarking

```ad-quote
In almost every strategy project, we do a best practice and benchmarking analysis to understand what we can learn from leading companies. We can do the same for individuals by looking at role models and then, more importantly, at the research on life satisfaction.
