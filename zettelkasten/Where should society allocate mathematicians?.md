# Where should society allocate mathematicians?

In this video, [[Grant Sanderson]] from 3blue1brown reflects on whether he is pleased with filtering students into studying mathematics. 

There is a prevailing idea that students who study math (or physics, or computer science) are far more capable of generalizing to other fields, such as logistics, due to their problem solving ability. 

Studying a field in university is effectively an apprenticeship *in that field*. You are training to be an expert or a researcher in that field. The question becomes "is this the most efficient way to allocate our human capital?".
