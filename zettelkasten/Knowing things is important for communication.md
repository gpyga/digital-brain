# Knowing things is important for communication
One note that was mentioned in the video: It is less important whether the person with whom I am speaking has read Romeo and Juliet, it is far more important if they know what the themes of Romeo and Juliet, what it means, as a method of communication. 

This is the anthropological view of education.
