# Learning contains social and environmental factors

## Themes
Note: I had a difficult time decoupling these themes, especially in the classroom analysis, which may imply they are more appropriately considered "two sides of the same theme".

Regardless of if you are viewing learning from a behaviorist or a social cognitive theory lens, *human learning is inherently social*. Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) is obviously social in nature - it *is* in the name! We see the social influences in SCT through impacts on instructional modes, environmental factors, and on motivation. Social instructional modes are seen in modeling and imitation, environmental factors can include friends being in the same course, and motivation can be social in nature through vicarious reinforcement and self-efficacy. (Ormrod, 2018).

Evidence of behaviorists' emphasis on social aspects are seen in chapters 3 and 4 from Ormrod (2018) in the numerous examples which are primarily focused on behavior modification which are largely social in nature. For example, Consider 7-year-old Andrea's physical aggression (Hall et al., 1971 as cited in Ormrod, 2018), her aggression towards others would be both disruptive in a classroom setting and would generally be deemed socially unacceptable (as would her self-harm). Many of the forms of effective punishment are also social in nature - verbal reprimand, time-outs and in-school suspension are all dependent on social interactions (Ormrod, 2018, p. 74). Furthermore, both Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) and Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) focus on promoting pro-social behavior and utilize socially-centric strategies such as coaching and group contingency (Ormrod, 2018, pp. 98-105).

Which relates to the next theme - *human learning is heavily dependent on the environment of the learner*. SCT explicitly points this out in the concept of reciprocal causality, having personal factors influence behavior influence environment, and vice versa. For SCT, the social factors of learning and the environmental factors are linked through the concepts of using models, which is naturally social and environmental (Ormrod, 2018, pp. 124-125). Behaviorist views, similarly, sees that learning depends on environmental factors through the mechanism of stimuli. Stimuli illicit a response from a person, whether that response is conditioned or unconditioned (Ormrod, 2018, p. 41), and that response is likely to act as a distraction to some degree for learners.

In classroom settings, there then is a need to control the environment to maximize the learning potential for all learners. This includes optimizing the physical environment and atmosphere; but, in my experience both as a student and as former tutor and STEM education volunteer, I believe these are largely social environmental controls - which is to say, promoting pro-social behavior and managing group dynamics in the classroom. 

## Question
Something I wrote while reading through chapters 3 and 4, though not related to my theme(s): "Is meta-cognition an effective strategy for extinction and/or counter-conditioning?" 

This question came up as I was thinking through substance misuse and its parallels with classical and operant conditioning. My hypothesis was that a desire for substances for misusers could be higher-order conditioned response to triggers based on learning the association that "trigger causes anxiety" and "substances reduce anxiety".
