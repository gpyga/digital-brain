# Semantic Web and Linked Data

I am drawn to the work about semantic web. This is actually the sort of thing which had drawn me to take this course as a non-MLIS student, but as a technologist of sorts. 

The need for information intermediaries
There is a concern that the producers of information are not to be trusted (metacrap). This only furthers the necessity of information intermediaries to organize the information independently. That being said, we risk finding ourselves in the same situation as the attempt of cataloging the entire web.

DBPedia is a fairly successful effort to build a knowledge graph.
