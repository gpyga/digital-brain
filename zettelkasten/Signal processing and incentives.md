# Signal processing and incentives

The relationship between economics, IS and learning seems to be tied into signals.

There exists some knowledge - intangible, potentially ephemeral. This can be information with varying levels of "truth" - for example, normative thoughts are less about "is" and more about "ought", information can also be tied to belief which is factually untrue, etc.

The sender will send a signal to a particular receiver or to the ether. 

Receivers will process the signal and its ability to actually cause a change in the receivers' mental associations is dependent on incentives, the clarity of the message, the pre-existing beliefs and mental associations, etc.

Within the minds of receivers, there is now a newly formed knowledge representation - which may or may not be shaped in the way that sender intended.
