# Knowledge and Learning are Latent

Ormrod explains that, by definition, learning is a "long-term change in mental representations or associations...", but learning can only be measured through changes in behavior (Ormrod, 2018, pp. 4-5). This implies that knowledge itself is immeasurable, as how can you directly measure a mental association? Granted, we may be able to measure a person's brain through electrical recording and neuroimaging while the participant is performing some task (Ormrod, 2018, p. 20), but that is far more an artifact of the change of behavior of the brain than it is a direct measurement of the knowledge itself. Though, Ormrod does also fairly explicitly state that the physical basis of what is meant by mental representations has not yet been completely identified (Ormrod, 2018, p. 4).

This impacts the way we view assessments within academic environments and highlights the importance of flexibility in assessment methods. In my experience as a learner in traditional school environments, assessment methods have been a one-size-fits-all approach with variation occurring largely with how individual instructors prefer assessments rather than assessments which fit the students. This is not a poor reflection on educators, as educators are already overburdened (Inc, 2022) and individualized assessment methods may not be feasible. 

Due to my STEM background, I find it helpful to think through the analogy of signal processing. Given an assessment (noisy channel), learners (information source) signal their knowledge to educators (destination); (Shannon & Weaver, 1949/1998). At the risk of being overly meta-analytical: as a learner, I am signaling, though a noisy channel of my writing, the latent knowledge and learning I have gained from the textbook (itself a noisy channel). It is impossible to truly measure to what degree I have absorbed the information, we can only observe my behavior (my writing) and infer my knowledge. Suppose, however, if I was not capable of writing to effectively portray my thoughts or my particular use of language was unclear. Then it would follow that the assessment of my knowledge would be at a disadvantage when compared to an assessment method that is more aligned to my strengths.

This then presents a responsibility on educators: if individualized assessments are not feasible, then act as correcting observers. In signal processing, one method is to introduce redundancy (MIT OpenCourseWare, 2014, 9:01-14:02). In an educational setting, this could be accomplished by introducing redundancy in target *mental representations* within the total assessment by observing additional and distinct behaviors. For example, an educator may observe a learner's written text as confusing and depend on redundant information present in schematics borrowed from famous electrical engineers' seminal work on information theory to infer what was intended in the text. An educator may also have exams which have a blend of short answer, multiple choice and oration to offer the learners multiple opportunities to signal their knowledge.

I want to make a special note to be clear: Correction within this context does not refer to *marks on assessment* (i.e., correct, incorrect, -0.5pts), it is referring to educators *inferring what the learner intended regardless of what was stated*. *Marks on assessments* act more as a feedback loop from the original destination (educator) to the original information source (learner) to make further corrections to the mental associations of the learner, which itself may present an additional signal processing challenge (Fujishin, 2009, p. 8).

**Question:**
In my theme on "Knowledge and Learning are Latent", I use the analogy of signal processing in assessment methods and having educators act as correcting observers in processing the assessment. I am wondering, from my educator peers, to what degree do you find yourself inferring what the student meant to say over what the student literally said? I'm curious how you use this in assessments. For example, in my more math-oriented coursework, instructors would often give partial credit when a slip-up lead to an incorrect conclusion if the logic followed from that point forward.
