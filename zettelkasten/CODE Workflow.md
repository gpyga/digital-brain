# CODE Workflow

CODE - stands for Capture, Organize, Distill and Express

## Capture
"Capture the ideas and insights you think are worth saving". 

## Organize
Organize the information that has been captured into a taxonomy that is effective. The simpler the better - but keep an eye for actionability. The [[PARA System]] organizes information with a more project-first orientation. 

```ad-note
Simplicity is  what I like about the link-centric approach of [[Zettlekasten]]. This method, however is agnostic to project management (see [[Combining Zettlekasten with Building a Second Brain]]).
```

## Distill
After capturing enough content, soon everything will need to be distilled. It is impossible to review a stack of notes when under duress (be it during an open-book exam, long workday, etc). Distilling to more bite-sized chunks of information will greatly reduce the cognitive load on retrieval.

```ad-note
This is an area where [[Generative AI]] and [[Large Language Models]] can come in handy; it's useful for embedding information for semantic retrieval, using [[Sparse Priming Representation]] for distillation and for sythesizing notes.
```

## Express
Creating and expression is how we present our thoughts into the world. [[2024 is the Year of Expression]], so this is a pertinent section of the workflow. 

```ad-note
For productivity, [[Tiago Forte]] recommends creating "intermediate packets" which can be reused ... [[Modularity Principle]]
```
