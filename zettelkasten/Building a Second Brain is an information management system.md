# Building a Second Brain is an information management system

```ad-quote
_Processing_of sources is not the focus of the system, nor is the _way_ of processing information an essential part of the system. Even the processing method Forte proposes, the _progressive summarization_ is not a processing method of information, but a _preparation method of resources like articles, podcasts, and books for later use_. BASB’s strengths lie in the management of sources of knowledge.

While BASB’s “second brain” doesn’t move beyond the resource, the work with the Zettelkasten begins only after we have extracted the ideas and thoughts from the resource and put each of them on an atomic note while leaving behind the resource. This is one of the main differences between BASB and the ZKM (Zettlekasten Method). BASB is a system for resource management; ZKM is a method for working with ideas themselves.
