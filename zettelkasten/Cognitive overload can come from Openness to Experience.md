# Cognitive overload can come from Openness to Experience

```ad-quote
Formulated as a belief set, the trait _Openness to experience_ would read: _What is new is most likely good._ Because we live in an age of information inflation,(8) we are inundated with newness. People with a high _Openness to Experience_ live in an information land of milk and honey. But people in the [Land of Cockaigne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Land_of_Cockaigne_(Bruegel)) are not happy. They are overstuffed and overwhelmed. They don’t know what to do with themselves. And those who don’t know what to do feel _anxiety_.(9) You could compare people with a high _Openness to Experience_ to people who have a particularly strong susceptibility to fast food and sweets. Both tend to engage in erratic behaviour, which in turn can lead to _anxiety_-generating lifestyles.
