# Isomorphisms contain an undo button

Suppose we have two morphism $f : A \rightarrow B$ and $g: B \rightarrow A$, then $f\circ g = 1_B$ and $f \circ g = 1_A$.

$f$ is then known as an isomorphism, and we can rewrite $g$ as $f^{-1}$ (or, similarly, $g$ is an isomorphism and we can rewrite $f$ as $g^{-1}$).

If there exists an isomorphism between two objects, then we write them as $A \cong B$.
