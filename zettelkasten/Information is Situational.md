# Information is Situational

I find there is overlap in the meaning of "information-as-process is situational" (Buckland, 1991, p. 356) with the 1949 work on rate of transmission over a discrete noisy channel (Shannon and Weaver, 1998, p. 67). Shannon and Weaver show that the value of the information transferred from the transmitter to the receiver is dependent on the noise introduced by the channel and on the observer's ability to correct any noise (Shannon and Weaver, 1998, p. 67). 

Generalizing that out to the broader scope of information-as-thing (Buckland, 1991; Shannon & Weaver, 1998), there are five elements to the transfer of information:
The information source (information-as-knowledge)
The transmitter (information-as-thing)
The noisy channel (information-as-process)
The receiver (application)
The observer (user)

As I write this discussion post, it is clear how information is situational. Many of my peers have a background in library science and education whereas my professional background is in statistics and computer science and my educational background is in physics. As the observer, I am reframing the knowledge embedded in "Information as Thing" to the mathematical theory presented by Shannon and Weaver. The signal processing analogy may not be useful to everyone, but the meta-analogy perhaps is.

We universally have the application domain of "learning and absorbing knowledge", regardless of what the future uses of that knowledge may be. All of us are different observers; some of these differences are in our field, and some are more specific to our individual lived experiences. The way we process this piece is situational in regards to our own experiences. Now, there is further situationality when the end application also differs, or with the possibility that information is redundant with pre-existing knowledge (Buckland, 1991, p. 357).
