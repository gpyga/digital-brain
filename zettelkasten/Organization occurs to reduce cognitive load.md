# Organization occurs to reduce cognitive load

Reflecting on the lecture's prompt to think about how we organize our kitchens, I've started to think about how organization occurs generally. We do not put toilets in the kitchen, we do not keep a refrigerator in our bathrooms; perishables go in the fridge or freezer (though, our definition of perishable may not all align). Without even fully consciously thinking about it, we taxonomize objects and sort accordingly. 

Doing so reduces the cognitive load and allows us to generalize in new situations. If we as a collective can generally agree on simple taxonomies, then we can effectively perform tasks regardless of specific environment.
