The Theme is a high-level word to orient small decisions that can improve your life. An example of a Theme would be "Year of Health", "Season of Reading", etc.

Setting specific, quantifiable goals for yourself can be demotivating when we observe that we may be off-track. Setting a Theme and using it as a guide for decision making helps form a trend in the "right direction".
