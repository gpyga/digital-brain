The Theme is a high-level word to orient small decisions that can improve your life. An example of a Theme would be "Year of Health", "Season of Reading", etc.

Setting specific, quantifiable goals for yourself can be demotivating when we observe that we may be off-track. Setting a Theme and using it as a guide for decision making helps form a trend in the "right direction".

The point isn't to create a goal or an objective that has to be met - disappointment will set in when you invariably fail to reach that goal. Instead, orient yourself to choose the "correct path" when facing a few options based on the theme. 

```ad-example
Suppose the theme is "Year of Health". When faced with the option of donut vs fruit for breakfast; you have more of an incentive to "choose fruit", as it is more "on theme". Importantly, failure to make this particlar choice doesn't completely ruin the theme or imply failure.
```
