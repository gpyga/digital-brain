# Theories and Brain Research are Tools, Not Rules

In one course I took last semester, *Intermediate Microeconomics*, we discussed models for competition. Perfect competition is the first model discussed, but it has the very important drawback of being terribly rare in the real-world. We learn perfect competition, however, as it is an important benchmark on which most other models and forms of competition are compared and there are plenty of useful inferences one can make with the perfect competition model. (V. Trindade, Intermediate Microeconomics lecture, n.d.; Goolsbee et al., 2016, p. 288). This too is present in the theories of human learning. Each theoretical framework has its benefits, including acting as inspiration and foundation for developing principles of learning (Ormrod, 2018, pp. 9-11). Ormrod promises to make the implications of each theory clear for educators throughout the text (Ormrod, 2018, p. 13).

The theories of human learning are models in which we can frame our knowledge about learning, but they do not offer a complete picture of what learning truly is (Ormrod, 2018, p. 7). We expect our theories to be wrong, but there is the question of whether or not the incorrectness is important (Box, 1976, p. 792). The title I chose to give this theme, in-and-of-itself, is a slight lie. Theories and the results of research are rules in the sense that they say something like, "if A, we expect B" (Box, 1976, p. 792). While the exercise in analyzing the truth of the statement is fun (for some), it is not *important*. I chose to say "tools, not rules" simply because the rhyming scheme would help me remember the concept - and hopefully offer an effective mnemonic for my peers. The relative cost-benefit of memorizing the concept seemed higher to me than the minor cost of the sentence's inaccuracy.

Similarly, brain research is a tool which may refine the theories of human learning by offering additional data on how humans process information and perform tasks, but the observations are impacted by imperfect measurement tools and experimental design (Ormrod, 2018, p. 20; Box, 1976, pp. 796-797). Brain research explicitly *does not* offer direct resources for educators in how to teach. Instead, it acts more as counter-evidence for existing models and prevailing myths in education. This  may do more to pull teaching methods away from practice than it does introduce new methods. (Ormrod, 2018, pp. 35-38).

Ormrod implores us to take an eclectic approach to human learning and cautions us of the risks associated with embedding oneself in a particular theory (Ormrod, 2018, pp. 11-12). Box, similarly, warns us using Francis Bacon's analogy of Pygmalion falling in love with his own model (Box, 1976, p. 791). I am excited to get into the course and find what is *useful*.
