# Cognitive overload can come from Intellect

```ad-quote
Formulated as a belief set, the trait _intellect_ would read: _Something is interesting if it is a thing that can be studied._ These people love to analyze and construct. These are the ones who get lost in analyzing and constructing a perfect system. They run the risk of doing more work on their system than using it for its intended purpose. They can become overwhelmed by a self-created information overload as they build an elaborate system of RSS feeds, web clippers, and other techniques of capturing information and information resources. But they also run the risk of conducting purposeless research, neglecting project- and deadline-oriented work.
