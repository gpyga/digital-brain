# Flipping the order of sales tactics to increase retention

Alexis Kingsley mentions in her video, "The Daily Routine That Changed My Life" (at about the 7m range) that she's noticed how more YouTubers in the self-help sphere are using a method where rather than saying "you need to do A because of X, Y, Z", they are saying "X, Y, Z - therefore A". 

My thought is that this may be helpful for my own learning an activity retention (which is to say, the rate at which I lose motivation). Focus on the application as the thing that hooks my attention.
