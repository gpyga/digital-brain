# Modularity is building Categories

```ad-note
I'm still working this out. A modular system is a set of morphisms which are associative. If we ever have a system which is designed such that $f: A \rightarrow B$ and $g: B \rightarrow C$, another system $h: B \rightarrow D$; then we will also have a new system $\mathcal{C}(A, D)=\{h\circ f\}$

I did find [[@spivakOperadicsMathematicsModular]], which seems to support this connection. More information to come.
