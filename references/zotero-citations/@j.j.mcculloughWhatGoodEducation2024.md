Learning facts vs. learning skills vs. learning ideas. What's the best education? Talking about the philosophy of Mortimer Adler, John Dewey, and E.D. Hirsch. In addition to the writings of the men themselves, some interesting books about Alder in particular I recommend are "A Great Idea at the Time" by Alex Beam, and "The Dream of a Democratic Culture" by Tim Lacy. Thanks to @MrBettsClass @ADoseofBuckley and Ben Kielesinski of TikTok fame for the voiceover work. SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/jjmccullough?...
