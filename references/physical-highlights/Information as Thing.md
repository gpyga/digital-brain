## Highlights
- Three meanings of "information" are distinguished: "information-as-process"; "information-as-knowledge"; and "information-as-thing," the attributive use of "information" to denote things regarded as informative. 
- On this view "information" includes nut extends beyond communication. Whatever information storage and retrieval systems store and retrieve is necessarily "information-as-thing."
- Since information has to do with becoming informed, with the reduction of ignorance and of uncertainty, it is ironic that the term "information" is itself ambiguous and used in different ways.
    - Note: This is an annoyance I have with many things in language.
- Faced with the variety of meaning of "information," we can, at least, take a pragmatic approach.
- Using this approach we identify three principal uses of the word "information:"
    - Note: Information-as-process; Information-as-knowledge; and Information-as-thing
- A key characteristic of "information-as-knowledge" is that it is intangible: one cannot touch it or measure it in any direct way.
    - Note: Only it's effect is measurable, which is to say, information-as-knowledge is latent.
- Therefore, to communicate them, they have to be expressed, described, or represented in some physical way, as a signal, text, or communication.
    - Note: Expression. Signaling meaning to other entities.
- Any such expression, description, or representation would be "information-as-thing."
    - Note: Generating a tangible object to transfer knowledge.
- Fairthorne (1954) objected scornfully to information as "stuff": "information is an attribute of the receiver's knowledge and interpretation of the signal, not of the sender's, nor some omniscient observer's nor of the signal itself."
    - Note: seems to be a disagreement with the Shannon-Weaver model, which places information at the source.
- If you can touch it or measure it directly, it is not knowledge, but must be some physical thing, possibly information-as-thing.
- This distinction may be overstated. Knowledge may well be represented in the brain in some tangible, physical way. 
    - Note: Neuroscience seems to concur; but it's not important
- Academic examinations test individuals' ability to answer questions or to solve problems, which is presumed to provide *indirect* measures of what they know.
    - Note: Knowledge is latent. Links to Human Learning, where learning includes "mental representations".
- Any such representation is necessarily in tangible form (sign, signal, data, text, film, etc.) and so *representations* of knowledge (and of events) are necessarily "information-as-thing."
    - Note: The "thing" really is just the signal.
- On these definitions, there can be no such thing as a "knowledge-based" expert system or a "knowledge access" system, only systems based on physical representations of knowledge
    - Note: seems a bit pedantic.
