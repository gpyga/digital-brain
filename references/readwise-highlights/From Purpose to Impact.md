## Highlights
- Your leadership purpose is who you are and what makes you distinctive. Whether you’re an entrepreneur at a start-up or the CEO of a Fortune500 company, a call center rep or a software developer, your purpose is your brand, what you’re driven to achieve, the magic that makes you tick. It’s not *what*you do, it’s *how*you do your job and *why*—the strengths and passions you bring to the table no matter where you’re seated. Although you may express your purpose in different ways in different contexts, it’s what everyone close to you recognizes as uniquely you and would miss most if you were gone.

    - Note: "purpose is not what you do, it's how ... and why"
- Next, Richard addresses his **three- to five-year goals**using the language of his purpose statement. We find that this is a good time frame to target first; several years is long enough that even the most disillusioned managers could imagine they’d actually be living into their purpose by then. But it’s not so distant that it creates complacency. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkdxe5ybjcbhgpn8pfferayy))
- Then he considers **two-year goals.**This is a time frame in which the grand future and current reality begin to merge. What new responsibilities will you take on? What do you have to do to set yourself up for the longer term? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkdxfemqbgvbgrazfg9j5cqf))
- The fifth step—setting **one-year goals**—is often the most challenging. Many people ask, “What if most of what I am doing today isn’t aligned in any way with my leadership purpose? How do I get from here to there?” We’ve found two ways to address this problem. First, think about whether you can rewrite the narrative on parts of your work, or change the way you do some tasks, so that they become an expression of your purpose.

- What did you especially love doing when you were a child, before the world told you what you should or shouldn’t like or do? Describe a moment and how it made you feel. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkbyqzr07dv4k9w0xsr5fz7b))
    - Note: I really enjoyed playing video games (especially strategy) and tinkering with things. I would spend hours doing what I considered playing, when in actuality, I was building or taking things apart or drawing. At its core, I think it was a joy of figuring things out.
      I think I really identify with the archetypes of the tactician and the engineer. I like being an advisor, I like being someone who makes things, I like being skilled in decision making.
- Tell us about two of your most challenging life experiences. How have they shaped you? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkbywnrzw9faejp31ja5s0a2))
    - Note: There was a period of time where I was struggling with depression to a degree where I couldn't get out of bed. I remember literally pissing in used bottles rather than walking to the bathroom. Frankly, I don't know what got me out of it - I was probably feeling a strong chemical low while also stressed out with school. I suppose in one regard, I have been shaped by this because it was my lowest (I was similarly extremely financially stressed). I now know what it's like to live in that condition and ... in reality, it's doable. I've done it. If something makes me that poor again, I can handle it.
- What do you enjoy doing in your life now that helps you sing your song? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkbz4jmn9krnnkkzkvkwchek))
    - Note: I think, just as when I was a child, I still love figuring things out and making things. I am fortunate enough to continue doing that as a career. I love that I continue to get smarter everyday and that I am able to make things.
- We strongly recommend grappling with these questions in a small group of a few peers, because we’ve found that it’s almost impossible for people to identify their leadership purpose by themselves. You can’t get a clear picture of yourself without trusted colleagues or friends to act as mirrors. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkbyq75bba9y15g1sxz189nx))
- We’ve found that most people can manage to devote 5% to 10% of their time to something that energizes them and helps others see their strengths. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkdxmjxce6d80szydhyn1597))
- After this reflective work, take a shot at crafting a clear, concise, and declarative statement of purpose: “My leadership purpose is _______.” The words in your purpose statement must be yours. They must capture your essence. And they must call you to action. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkbztbnnqe2czrg8c76hck5s))
    - Note: ad meliora
- Now we get to the nitty-gritty. What are the **critical next steps**that you must take in the coming six months, three months, and 30 days to accomplish the one-year goals you’ve set out? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hke3jve39z7nt4y8nrv951e0))
