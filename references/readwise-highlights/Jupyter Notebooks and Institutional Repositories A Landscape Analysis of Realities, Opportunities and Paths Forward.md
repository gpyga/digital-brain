- Category: #articles
- Summary: Jupyter Notebooks are important digital outputs in modern scholarship, but their place within institutional repositories is still uncertain. This paper explores the current landscape of Jupyter Notebooks and their potential integration into institutional repositories as scholarly assets. The authors discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with bringing Jupyter Notebooks into repositories, including the need for appropriate tools, schemas, and metadata standards. They also examine the accessioning of Jupyter Notebooks into existing institutional repositories and explore the application of metadata schemas like CodeMeta. The paper concludes with a case study of how the National Center for Atmospheric Research assesses and prepares its own collection of Jupyter Notebooks for deposit into its institutional repository.

## Highlights
- Github, while a platform likely to exist for a long time, is not an institutional repository (IR), and does not share the same commitment to preservation and permanence as traditional IRs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn6c93wzgen6namqrgp6mtzb))
    - Note: Github is a for-profit entity (subsidiary of Microsoft) which acts more as a social code hub than an institutional repository.
- To address this issue, the Software Heritage service ([https://www.softwareheritage.org/](https://www.softwareheritage.org/)) has been created to preserve the contents of Github repositories, among others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn6d1b0rrt635vn1j7k4y2pk))
- It is clear, however, that before we can understand their place among assets which are already accepted, we must address one of the primary barriers to accepting notebooks into traditional repository infrastructure: metadata.

- Whether inconsistent or altogether absent, any digital asset without proper and appropriate metadata is as good as a ghost within the wide and vast repositories operated by the best academic institutions around the world.

- First, the rise of *computational thinking* in modern scientific disciplines is now unavoidable ([Wing, 2011](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/17751#cited39)). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn6dmczv5dsw9q7m445jc6p0))
- Many feel that these notebooks and their interactive features hint at the future of all scientific explanation that provides the transparency and auditability necessary for computational-centric science to progress ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn6dv7nehjqhdv4bvgs4p2e5))
- Similarly, containerization methodologies such as Data and Software Preservation for Open Science (DASPOS) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn6ed4nz133xpkeghbz16t6v))
