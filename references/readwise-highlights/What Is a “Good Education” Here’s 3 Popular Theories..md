## Highlights
- important to teach practical life skills Theory 2 says it is most important to teach the big ideas and arguments of wise people and Theory 3 says it is most important to teach hard facts about the world now obviously everybody agrees on some level that learning all of this stuff is important but most of us also have a bias that points Us in One Direction More than the others you can even think of this in relation to the other educational YouTube channels that you subscribe to do you prefer watching videos videos that tell you stories ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkp1g78m2b98cpx3j5vzbt30))
    - Note: three main theories: teach skills which are useful, teach the "big ideas", teach the facts.
- about famous people places and events or do you prefer videos that give you instruction and advice on how to perform specific tasks and solve specific problems or do you prefer videos where people discuss different philosophies and ideologies or analyze and debate contentious topics over the last century or so a lot of very smart people have spent a lot of time arguing with each other trying to figure out which of these three approaches to education is best which folus provides the best ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkp1jym57mnjjypdeq14fk83))
    - Note: All the things!
- decide what courses they want to take or what books they want to read or what topic they want to write their reports on this seems to just be the natural way that people pursue education when left to their own devices if you once again think about YouTube to the extent that any of us are interested in continuing to acquire new skills outside of school it is usually only in Realms we are already interested in doing things we are already pretty good at doing Mortimer J Adler had been a student of dwey when he was teaching at the ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkp1t07y7mf32e890bc2j881))
    - Note: It's interesting to see this as a criticism. I think there is something to be said about being a "well-rounded" individual, but enforced exploration would tend to turn a person off from happening upon a subject.
- time arguing at length about why his philosophy of education was the right one here is an exerpt of a 1960 essay he wrote as part of a cover story in wisdom magazine which apparently was the thing that existed at one time experience is not enough it is also necessary to think reflectively to ask questions to seek answers reading what other men have thought helps us think about our own experience it is here that the great books are are so much better than all ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkp22yzq0f9cshdb88q0x11k))
    - Note: outside of the idea of "reading what other men have thought" bit, this is ultimately advocating for reflexivity.
- least partly credible that I've only begun to understand the ethics on the 10th 15th or 20th reading it is not a book but Aristotle is not an easy writer another criticism was that Adler's fixation on the ideas of books and thinkers made him incurious about the historical and social context in which those books and ideas were created so like some would argue that you cannot really understand Renee diart without ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkp28b9j1pyn5peggq9vka1z))
    - Note: This really implies that it is less the reading of Descartes, Aristotle, Epicurus, etc that is important, but rather the distilled ideas. Why waste time with the Great Books when I can use the Great Sparknotes?
- these sorts of criticisms all he had to do was update his list of mustre books to include more modern writers and writers representing more diverse backgrounds but Adler himself was never particularly receptive to this kind of feedback and became more stubborn and frankly even somewhat more bigoted as he aged arguing that the authors that he cared about were the only ones that mattered and say women and black authors were mostly relevant in terms of their engagement with the great ideas but that ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkp2b0s3t21v6eg9txb1k0qw))
    - Note: go figure...
- what other people know is the key to effective communication with your fellow man it was an anthropological view of Education in the sense that it sought to acknowledge the role that knowledge played in American society as it actually existed in his most famous book he wrote an anthropological theory of Education accepts the naturalness as well as the relativity of human cultures the anthropological view stresses the universal fact that a human group must have effective Communications to function effectively that effective ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkp2e92jrbk6c4h8hetjm7n8))
    - Note: This is arguably a "skills-based approach"; emphasizing the skill of parable, of metaphor, etc.
- Cultural Literacy should be understood in a non-ideological way and that lists of facts worth knowing should always seek to reflect what the culture as a whole considers important rather than any one political party government or even teacher and this is something that's worth keeping in mind when we think about the ways in which adults consume fact-based educational content after they're finished with school whether that be through books or podcasts or YouTube videos or whatever else are we seeking to consume ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkp2kmkj9fznjjjxq8z6fz64))
    - Note: Okay, but ironically, aren't the facts that are most culturally relevant driven by the facts which were taught in the past? Suppose that Romeo and Juliet was spuriously deemed culturally significant at time $t$, at time $t+1$, it is still culturally relevant.
- the legacy of all three of them in the culture of learning and education that defines modern America I don't think there are many people that would argue that learning skills facts or ideas are unimportant and most of us probably think that a good education isn't simply a matter of doubling down on one option over another as much as getting the overall balance right and on that note let me ask you what your preference is since you are watching my channel it might be fair to assume that you are more of a fact person but then again ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkp2r9d018asa990wysb0f5n))
