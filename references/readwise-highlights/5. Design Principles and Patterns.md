- Document Note: Based on the information provided in the document, a cohesive module is a module that has a unified purpose or focus. This means that all the methods or functions within the module work together towards a common goal or objective. The document emphasizes the importance of modularity and abstraction in achieving the goal of creating a program that is easy to maintain and modify. Cohesion is one of the factors that contribute to the modularity of a system, and it is achieved by decomposing the system into cohesive, loosely coupled modules. The document also explains the different degrees of cohesion, ranging from coincidental cohesion to informational cohesion. Overall, the document is about design principles and patterns that help developers create programs that are useful, usable, and modifiable.

## Highlights
- The goal of every program is to be **useful** (solve the right problems), **usable** (easy to use), and **modifiable** (easy to maintain). Two important design principles that help developers achieve the last goal are modularity and abstraction: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtx6ht45c4jntv0y4znxe8t))
- Systems should be decomposed into cohesive, loosely coupled modules. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtx6xc1p7vdj175enfdwca8))
    - Note: Modularity Principle
- The interface of a module should be independent of its implementation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtx78drmv3rrgwpv9w0a66y))
    - Note: Abstraction Principle
- Both of these principles are valid for several different definitions of module: function, object, class, ADT, or package.[[1]](http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/faculty/pearce/ooa/chp5.htm#_ftn1) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtx906k8q3r8jqq1d5m1ken))
    - Note: "A module is any type of program component that encapsulates one or more declarations. These could be declarations of classes, fields, or methods. Under this definition, a function isn't really a module, but rather an abstraction."
- A cohesive module has a unified purpose, while loose coupling implies dependencies on other modules are minimized. Taken together, this makes a module easier to reuse, replace, and understand. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtxnbpjcgcq9b926fxr8shs))
    - Note: By "unified purpose", he means "all elements of the module work together on a common task - there is no dead weight".
- The abstraction principle implies that the external function or purpose of a module (the module's interface) should be separated from its internal structure (the module's implementation). A dependency on such a module is only a dependency on its public interface, not its private implementation. This frees clients[[2]](http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/faculty/pearce/ooa/chp5.htm#_ftn2) from the need to understand implementation details, while implementers are free to modify the implementation without the fear of breaking client code. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtxqvc2etr97q3w9qzff34m))
    - Note: This is important. The knowledge required to interface with low-level code is far too high and needlessly incurs cognitive costs.
- Although there is no precise way to measure the cohesiveness of a class, we can identify several common "degrees" of cohesiveness. At the low end of our spectrum is coincidental cohesion. A class exhibits **coincidental cohesion** if the tasks its methods perform are totally unrelated: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtxy5df8xzcny468yqd6bps))
    - Note: "coincidental cohesion" - cohesion because the methods are "coinciding" in the same class
- The next step up from coincidental cohesion is logical cohesion. A class exhibits **logical cohesion** if the tasks its methods perform are conceptually related. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjty1jk424mn1vxcw5cgaf33))
- class AreaFuns { 
  �� double circleArea() { ... } 
  �� double rectangleArea() { ... } 
  �� double triangleArea() { ... } 
  } ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjty2dqytbz0f9813f3kzcrf))
- A logically cohesive class also exhibits **temporal cohesion** if the tasks its methods perform are invoked at or near the same time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjty2n1az0kx0eqpzbs2kk60))
- class InitFuns { 
  �� void initDisk() { ... } 
  �� void initPrinter() { ... } 
  �� void initMonitor() { ... } 
  } ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjty2q4k2jxencpg816sj06q))
- One reason why coincidental, logical, and temporal cohesion are at the low end of our cohesion scale is because instances of such classes are unrelated to objects in the application domain. For example, suppose x and y are instances of the InitFuns class: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjty50k64f03yp8mre0r23xh))
    - Note: Category Theory? These are "low on the scale" due to their lack of relatedness to objects; which to me, sounds like a lack of mappings
- A class exhibits **procedural cohesion**, the next step up in our cohesion scale, if the tasks its methods perform are steps in the same application domain process. For example, if the application domain is a kitchen, then cake making is an important application domain process. Each cake we bake is the product of an instance of a MakeCake class: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtybftt15gqgsandsjf4kb2))
    - Note: This is describing a callable class or a factory, where the instantiation is running a process.
- A class exhibits **informational cohesion** if the tasks its methods perform are services performed by application domain objects. Our Airplane class exhibits informational cohesion, because different instances represent different airplanes: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtyd6n1m8b7z9k88xvecwbb))
    - Note: This is an object in the truest sense - we instantiate an "airplane" and it can do things that airplanes do, like takeoff, fly, land
- Note that the informational cohesion of this class is ruined if we add a method for computing taxes or browsing web pages. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtyf45dytx38m9t75916s5g))
- Assume A and B are classes, interfaces, or packages. A depends on B if changes to B could cause changes to A. UML represents dependency using dependency arrows: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtyk2beb3x7w847ptc4jhxk))
- ![](https://imgproxy.readwise.io/?url=http%3A//www.cs.sjsu.edu/faculty/pearce/ooa/chp5_files/image002.gif&hash=8363e8c1b1a73c9cc89463c1f9f3aec1) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtyk4jyvh60pbx7mpjvq8n0))
- We symbolize this relationship as:
  A << B ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtykek15ejgmskapa5bz4nw))
- Dependency is a reflexive, transitive relationship:
  A << A 
  A << B and B << C implies A << C ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtym568yk7zphwnmte5gvsf))
- A references B implies A << B
  Where A references B if:
  1. A extends or implements B 
  2. A has a field of type B 
  3. A has a method that references B 
  4. B appears as a template parameter in A (C++ only) 
  5. B is a friend of A (C++ only) 
  6. A references a B pointer, reference, or array
  A method, A.m, references B if:
  1. B appears in the signature of A.m 
  2. A.m has a local variable of type B 
  3. A.m uses a global variable of type B (C++ only) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtyqedjcjbe65yk9cq258yj))
- One might wonder if there are other, sneaky ways for class A to depend on class B. Certainly any such "hidden" dependencies would make A harder to understand, modify, or reuse. The **Transparency Principle**[[3]](http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/faculty/pearce/ooa/chp5.htm#_ftn3) suggests that programmers avoid hidden dependencies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtywvqnhjzgnzjwxbnc2h8f))
- We can formalize the Transparency Principle by demanding that the dependency relationship is no more than the transitive closure of the *references* relationship:
  A << B implies A references some C where C << B
  The transitive closure of A:
  TC(A) = { B | A << B }
  gives us an idea of how much support A requires. For example, if A is a stand-alone class, then:
  TC(A) = { A }
  Clearly, the larger TC(A) is, the harder it is to reuse, understand, or replace A. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtyxggc52kh0k1406c6mag3))
    - Note: Easily extends to objects.
- Bi-directional dependencies are possible ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtzr3s72x5n79hcn9hc4hm2))
- ![](https://imgproxy.readwise.io/?url=http%3A//www.cs.sjsu.edu/faculty/pearce/ooa/chp5_files/image012.gif&hash=a6412afe5006d52feb06c81207432f10) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5t89ahqjb8xaq4b8tgw74j))
    - Note: Container is agnostic to the component it is using
- Notice that the container doesn't know the type of components it uses. It only knows that its components realize or implement the IComponent interface. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5ta8sgae91m2z0qf13wes4))
- The concept of coupling refines the notion of dependence by attempting to qualify and quantify the strength of the dependency of one class on another. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtzsm52n225yay5063591jt))
- If A and B are loosely coupled, only major changes to certain methods of B should impact A. If A and B are tightly coupled, then small changes to B can have a dramatic impact on A. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtzstzfgdk9et1zq1txax25))
- Saving an object to a file or database, or sending this object to a remote object over a network will require saving or sending the entire transitive closure of that object. The size of the transitive closure-- called the encumbrance of a class, package, or object-- is a crude measure of the required set of support:
  encumbrance(A) = |TC(A)| ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtyzvrxv5zashxggfh60n95))
- Normally, this would mean that the Transaction class has a member variable that points to a Customer:
  class Transaction { 
  �� Customer customer; 
  �� // etc. 
  }
  Some changes to the Customer class will impact the Transaction class, but some will not. For example, changing the private members of the Customer class should have no impact. This is the most common form of coupling. For lack of a better term, we will call this **client coupling**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtzv96aycvjsfyzhgw7nvwz))
- ![](https://imgproxy.readwise.io/?url=http%3A//www.cs.sjsu.edu/faculty/pearce/ooa/chp5_files/image014.gif&hash=5bb02e48c2c229477df72a7c50afdee5) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5tbvjrmkr25rrj8krfe1se))
- Notice that all three realizations of the Aircraft interface support additional operations: airplanes can bank, helicopters can hover, and blimps can deflate. However, the pilot doesn't get to call these functions. The pilot only knows about the operations that are specifically declared in the Aircraft interface. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5tbkrqjswrm8181fz6vv9x))
- if a C++ Transaction class is a friend of the Customer class:
  class Customer 
  { 
  �� friend class Transaction; 
  �� // etc. 
  };
  Then Transaction is **content coupled** to Customer. Changes to the private members of Customer could impact Transaction. Declaring one class to be the friend of another tightens the coupling between the two classes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtzvqxj2k7m2v55gtfqm057))
- If Customer is an interface for corporate and individual customers:
  Then the Transaction class can't even be sure what type of object its customer pointer points at. There is no mention in the Transaction class of corporate or individual customers, only customers. Transactions can call public Corporate and Individual methods that are explicitly declared in the Customer interface. Other public methods such as Corporate::getCEO() or Individual::getSpouse() are not visible to transaction objects. Transaction exhibits **interface coupling** with the Corporate and Individual classes. Obviously interface coupling is looser than client coupling. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjtzy4agxevstnyrxzvv6tzb))
- Message passing also helps to loosen the coupling between objects. For example, suppose an object representing an ATM machine mediates between transactions and customers:
  In this case transactions and customers communicate by passing messages through the ATM machine, which means that the transaction doesn't even need to know the location of the customer. We shall call this **message coupling** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjv00ps9n5kpemxnykh81frh))
- Short of totally uncoupled, we can achieve the loosest form of coupling by combining interface and message coupling. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjv01sn3aasfhkphzgmyh70y))
- Domains ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjv0kykh82c1nfkrrq3zjdxd))
    - Note: The topic of domains implies that there is a hierarchy of modules (understandably). It's good to keep foundational classes available to everyone, architectural classes may be mildly domain specific. Then we get into domain specific and application-specific domains, where there is going to be very little reusability outside of the particular application/domain
- 1. Foundationl classes 
  2. Architectural classes 
  3. Domain-specific classes 
  4. Application-specific classes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjv0cd7ngnnafk5j2qtc75qe))
    - Note: 4 levels of dependency
- The term "domain" refers to the **application domain**. This is the real world context of the application. Health care, business, manufacturing, and engineering are broad examples of application domains. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjv0ed27er9c536z9zv4hdaw))
- Examples of foundational components include quantities, strings, dates, and containers. A quantity is a number together with a unit, such as "3.5 US dollars", or "3.5 kilometers". A container is a data structure that holds other objects. Stacks, queues, lists, and arrays are common examples. It's easy to imagine that a well designed stack would be useful in a wide variety of applications cutting across architectures and domains. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjv0g4m6m2hgzmmf1hhqkewb))
- An **interface** is a collection of operator specifications. An operator specification may include a name, return type, parameter list, exception list, pre-conditions, and post-conditions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjv0v8ns8ncnchjeeff28axa))
- A **software component** is an object that is known to its clients only through the interfaces it implements. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjv0wbgxxg9az7ddxhr7phgh))
- Often, the client of a component is called a **container**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjv0ww70vctdr38pdwrj1r1f))
