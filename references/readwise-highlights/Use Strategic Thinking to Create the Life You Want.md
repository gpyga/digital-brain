- Critics might say that you can’t transfer concepts from business to life. In the 1960s there were similar concerns about whether strategy ideas from the military and politics could apply to the corporate world. The management guru Peter Drucker even changed the title of his 1964 book from *Business Strategy* to [*Managing for Results*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780434903900/managing-for-results) because everyone he and his publisher asked told them that strategy belonged to those realms, not to business. Yet we’ve also seen business-world principles employed to improve people’s self-management. For example, in their best-selling book [*Designing Your Life*](https://designingyour.life/the-book/)*,* Stanford University’s Bill Burnett and Dave Evans modified the design thinking they used in software development to help individuals.

- Other research shows many of us are on a “hedonic treadmill”: After we get a pay raise, are promoted, or purchase something that triggers a pleasurable high, we return to our original level of happiness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkbdqp7c5bpwew4nxg4n690h))
- The late Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen agreed: In his classic HBR article “[How Will You Measure Your Life?](https://hbr.org/2010/07/how-will-you-measure-your-life)” he wrote, “I’ve concluded that the metric by which God will assess my life isn’t dollars but the individual people whose lives I’ve touched.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkbds3cyd154yqjavex1a3b6))
    - Note: something something "measure of a man, merely count his friends"
- To determine what makes a great life for you, start with each element in PERMA-V, or even add your own categories, such as autonomy or spirituality. Then rate each one’s importance to you on a scale from 0 (not important) to 10 (very important). Try to recall periods of deep satisfaction in your past and consider what triggered them.

- For a corporate strategy to be successful, it must be anchored to the organization’s purpose, which lies at the intersection of, What are we good at? and What does the world need?, and takes into account, What are our values? and What excites us? Using these questions, we’ve helped companies around the world develop purpose statements. A purpose statement serves as an important guardrail for your strategy and is a North Star for your organization. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkbec0eepahns7fcv0pagdcm))

- The same questions can be used to find your life purpose. Ask yourself, What am I good at? Think about situations at work or in other areas of life in which you have demonstrated critical strengths such as creativity, teamwork, or communication. Then ask, What are my core values? Think about critical decisions you’ve made and principles you hold dear that have provided direction, such as honesty, fairness, or integrity. There are dozens of online [lists](https://jamesclear.com/core-values) and tests to help you consider your most important values. The next question is, Which activities light me up? Perhaps your answers include mentoring, problem-solving, or engaging with different types of people. Finally, ask, What need can I help address in the world? It could be one of the 17 [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals) of the United Nations, such as health, education, gender equality, or climate action, or it could be something much more general, such as love, kindness, trust, or security.

    - Note: What matters to me? There are values, but there are also issues and approaches
- Draw from your own answers and theirs to draft a purpose statement, and then ask for feedback on it. Or you can engage ChatGPT in an interactive dance, using the answers to the four questions as input to help you develop your purpose statement, as Tom, a climate physicist, did in one of our recent workshops.

    - Note: I appreciate the direct openness to using ChatGPT for reflection.
- When Joudi, a Kurdish refugee from Syria currently living in Germany, went through this exercise, he identified his core strengths as ambition, passion, and hunger for knowledge. His core values were justice, peace, family, and charity. He said he was most excited by innovation, neurosurgery, and entrepreneurship (notably his experiences selling accessories as a street vendor in Istanbul and founding a multilingual AI-powered integration support platform for Ukrainians who had fled their country for Germany). As for the world needs he wanted to address, Joudi cited health care, freedom, and equality. In the end, he wrote this purpose statement: “Remain medically passionate, willing to learn, entrepreneurial, and strong-willed to drive medical innovation and create equitable access to health care for people.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkbegz4syw995h44zjrv2jk7))
- Individuals should also strive to envision who they want to become in the years ahead. As the Stoic philosopher Seneca said, “If you do not know which port you are sailing to, no wind is favorable.” At the same time, you want to remain open to surprises and serendipity. Seneca commented on this as well: “Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.” Strategizing your life is the preparation.

- For this step we have used a photo-sorting exercise similar to what our corporate clients use in branding and innovation strategy projects. Out of 180 photos, workshop participants select two to four that best represent their personal and professional vision — what one person described as a “mood board.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkbepw89v5rkv2yvteyjny4k))
- You might end up with a short list of bullet points or a one-sentence summary of your vision. No matter how you capture it, a vision statement can be powerful in guiding your life. An example we love comes from our colleague Sebastian when he was 14. After a poor math test result, his teacher told him, “Teaching you is a waste of time” and warned he’d never get a high school diploma. For the next couple of years Sebastian took that to heart, skipped school, and started working as a bricklayer. Eventually, however, he decided to make a change, and it began with this vision statement: “I will go to university and get a PhD and then go back to my math teacher — all in the next 10 years.” He did just that, graduating summa cum laude with a PhD in economics, and in another 10 years he was a managing director and a partner at BCG.

- Look back at the past year, including holidays, and assess how much time you spent on each of the 16 SLUs in an average week. When an activity crosses categories, split the time between them. For example, if you went jogging with your significant other for one hour a week, allocate half an hour to the significant other SLU and half an hour to the physical health/sports SLU. Next, rate all 16 SLUs on a scale of 0 to 10 based on how important they are to you. Then rate the satisfaction you derive from each on the same scale. (This goes one level deeper than the similar PERMA-V exercise.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkbf2awxrrp6t5ss2xsrenyd))
- In almost every strategy project, we do a best practice and benchmarking analysis to understand what we can learn from leading companies. We can do the same for individuals by looking at role models and then, more importantly, at the research on life satisfaction. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkbgaykq6zzsh28462yd1z9x))
- On the other hand, you have only 168 hours each week, which means you must reduce, outsource, or bundle existing activities, or make them more efficient through productivity strategies and tools. For example, when you work out with your boyfriend or volunteer for a good cause with your friends, you are bundling sports and significant other or societal engagement and friendship. Life strategy is about setting priorities; it is not about filling every waking minute. Remember to reserve space in your calendar for downtime as well. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and UCLA’s Anderson School of Management [found that](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspp0000391.pdf) people are happiest when they have two to five hours of free time each day.

    - Note: Rational consumers maximize their utility relative to budget constraints. In this case, the budget is time.
- If you know which strategic life unit needs work but don’t know what changes to make, dig deeper and develop a substrategy for that unit — a job/career strategy, a family strategy, a mental health/mindfulness strategy, and so on — just as each business unit does with the overarching corporate strategy.

- Change is not easy. Need proof? More than 40% of Americans set New Year’s resolutions each January, and [reports](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2013/01/01/just-8-of-people-achieve-their-new-years-resolutions-heres-how-they-did-it/?sh=526f57d2596b) indicate that more than 90% fail to follow through on them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkbfssy37n0mcxxdesw8j9dh))
    - Note: Don't use resolutions! Use themes!
- Many companies, such as Google, ensure successful implementation of the strategies they’ve outlined by using OKRs (objectives and key results). OKRs are focused, ambitious, output-oriented, flexible, measurable, and transparent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkbfvy7f9cfcx0n5msfzq4h1))
    - Note: Are OKRs similar to themes? In a way, yes - but I'm curious if there is more of a connection there. OKR are a bit more specific and well defined. OKRs can fit under themes (modular)
- And *check-ins* means routinely stepping back, refining and adjusting your efforts, and celebrating your achievements, as agile project development teams do. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkbfycmm6a5x45mzxp27d3k3))
