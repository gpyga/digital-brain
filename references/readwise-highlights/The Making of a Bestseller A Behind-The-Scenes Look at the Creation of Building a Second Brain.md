## Highlights
- CODE is a **proven process for consistently turning the information you consume into creative output and concrete results.** And it’s based on timeless principles that humans throughout history have used to create anything imaginable.

- and for whatever notetaking methods and platforms you prefer ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjmmpzve18973ev8nxbzj1h7))
    - Note: including Zettlekasten
- The first step in building a Second Brain is **“capturing” the ideas and insights you think are worth saving**. Ask yourself:
  • What are the recurring themes and questions that I always seem to return to in my work and life?
  • What insightful, high-value, impactful information do I already have access to that could be valuable?
  • Which knowledge do I want to interconnect, mix and match, and periodically resurface to stimulate future thinking on these subjects? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjmmsn09ne79ga6hv28qt4z7))
- Instead, your rule of thumb should be to **save anything that “resonates” with you on an intuitive level.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjmmy4jyjtped63pezw2rpc9))
- When it comes to digital notes, **simpler and more flexible organization methods are preferable.** Our priorities and goals can change quickly, so we should avoid organizing methods that are overly rigid and prescriptive. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjmnd1zwga242apfnr01kh4t))
- Once you start collecting valuable knowledge in a centralized place, you’ll naturally start to notice patterns and connections. An article you read on gardening will give you an insight into online marketing. An offhand comment by a client will give you the idea of creating a webpage with client testimonials. A business card you saved from a conference will remind you to follow up and propose a collaboration.
  You can greatly facilitate and speed up this process by **distilling your notes into actionable, bite-sized summaries.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjmngxkmnbbcm3y4psk5rq2s))
- A powerful mindset for interacting with our notes is to **“design notes with your future self in mind.”** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjmnwfax1hbgm248x11my97q))
- Every time you create a note or make an edit, you can **make it just a little easier to find and make use of next time.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjmnwtx6x5be4ejktec9d75d))
- This can include:
  • Defining key terms in case we forget what they mean
  • Inserting placeholders when we leave off so we know where to pick back up
  • Adding links to related websites, files, or emails that we’re likely to forget over time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjmnx71y16qxts3wsh91x492))
- Whether we want to lose weight, get a promotion at work, start a side business, or contribute to a cause we believe in, **the true purpose of learning is to turn our knowledge into effective action.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjmpc1408chj2hdv5rarbb20))
- You will begin to think of your projects as made up of discrete parts. 
  I call them **Intermediate Packets**, which can include any kind of content we’ve already mentioned: a set of notes from a team meeting, a list of relevant research findings, a brainstorm with collaborators, a slide deck analyzing the market, or a list of action items from a conference call, for example. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjmpfpapxfkxgytr9zzprh4d))
    - Note: This is getting into modularity
- There are many benefits all along the process of building a Second Brain: less stress, better focus, more insights, and enhanced productivity. But the real payoff comes at the end, **when you create something out of the knowledge you’ve collected and share it with the world.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjmq17qap0csnbkacyytrkwb))
- you’ll start to realize that **there is no such thing as a finished product.**
  Everything is in flux, everything is a work in progress, and everything you put out there has an implicit “version 1.0” attached to it. 
  This can be tremendously empowering – since nothing is ever final, **there is no need to wait to get started**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjmq47x97v6b7r12vkny72ht))
