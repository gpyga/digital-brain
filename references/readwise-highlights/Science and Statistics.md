## Highlights
- 2.3 Parsimony Since all models are wrong the scientist cannot obtain a "correct" one by excessive elaboration. On the contrary following William of Occam he should seek an economical description of natural phenomena. Just as the ability to devise simple but evocative models is the signature of the great scientist so overelaboration and overparameteriza- tion is often the mark of mediocrity.

- 2.4 Worrying Selectively Since all models are wrong the scientist must be alert to what is importantly wrong. It is inappropriate to be con- cerned about mice when there are tigers abroad. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmnxawffsa875sy8andq5bhy))
- It follows that, although rigorous derivation of logical consequences is of great importance to statistics, such derivations are necessarily encapsulated in the knowledge that premise, and hence consequence, do not describe natural truth. It follows that we cannot know that any statistical technique we develop is useful unless we use it. Major advances in science and in the science of statistics in particular, usually occur, therefore, as the result of the theory-practice iteration.
