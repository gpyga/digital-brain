## Highlights
- Marginalization becomes useful if not all variables are observed: given a joint probability
  distribution on some variables, we obtain a marginal distribution on a subset of the variables by integrating out the remaining variables. Analogously, we can marginalize an acyclic SCM by substituting the solutions of the structural equations of a subset of the endogenous variables into the structural equations of the remaining endogenous variables.
