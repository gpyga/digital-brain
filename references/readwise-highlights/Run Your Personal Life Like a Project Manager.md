## Highlights
- This experiment (put into play around two years ago) has also made it a lot easier for me to manage my day-to-day now that the lines between home and office have been so indelibly blurred. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjr81t8mfzpevsevte6z8n18))

- Of all of the PM tricks, this one is probably the most important. Each and every week, schedule 15 minutes to sit down (no distractions!) and determine what you need and want to accomplish, from smaller to-dos (sending birthday cards for the month) to bigger, meatier projects (creating a gallery wall in your living room) and on what timeframe. I have a recurring weekly calendar invite to myself for this time--usually on Friday afternoons before the weekend chaos kicks in.

    - Note: 15 minutes seems short?
- While the Scrum approach is often used for software development, there are plenty of principles that can be applied to personal projects, especially when they involve other people. The Scrum framework involves daily check-ins, short "sprints" of work, and retrospectives to review how the sprint went. I can see this being particularly helpful for busy families [like mine](https://www.inc.com/amanda-pressner-kreuser/heres-how-superhero-working-moms-say-they-get-it-all-done-without-driving-themselves-crazy.html) to remind us to check in with one another, reflect on how we're feeling, and plan upcoming activities like vacations and outings.

    - Note: I mean, you can use Kanban boards with Scrum. Scrum is likely appropriate for my life, given the weekly cadence of deadlines.
- As any project manager knows, it's important to break down projects into smaller tasks, to help anticipate exactly how long something's going to take. You can organize those by dependency or deadline, especially if you're often guilty of [procrastination](https://www.inc.com/amanda-pressner-kreuser/cant-stop-procrastinating-heres-surprising-thing-that-says-about-your-personality.html) (who isn't?).

- Apply that same approach to your personal chores. If your "project" is to clean the kitchen, break that down into smaller chunks like wiping the counters, doing the dishes, and cleaning out the fridge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjr8b5tfagyybypkw7d53rzz))
