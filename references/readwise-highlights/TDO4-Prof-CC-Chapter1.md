## Highlights
- Geoff Nunberg has eloquently explained in Farewell to the Information Age that information is “a collection of notions, rather than a single coherent concept.” Michael Buckland’s oft-cited essay Information as Thing argues against the notion that information is inherently intangible and instead de­ fines it more broadly and provocatively based on function.

- In contrast, the informatics or computer science perspective takes an abstract view of “docu­ ment” to refer to any self-contained unit of information, separating a docu­ ment's content from its presentation or container.2[Com] ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkrtpx5gjnwm4mg0f91chtkh))
- Astute readers might have noticed that we included sensor data as “infor­ mation about physical things” and data feeds as “information about digital things.” Many textbooks in the information science and knowledge manage­ ment fields distinguish data and information in a more precise way. To them, data sits at the bottom of an Information Hierarchy, Knowledge Pyramid, or DIKW Hierarchy in which Data is transformed into Information, which is transformed into Knowledge, which is then transformed into Wisdom.
