## Highlights
- Geoff Nunberg has eloquently explained in Farewell to the Information Age that information is “a collection of notions, rather than a single coherent concept.” Michael Buckland’s oft-cited essay Information as Thing argues against the notion that information is inherently intangible and instead de­ fines it more broadly and provocatively based on function. A resource that can be learned from or serve as evidence is “information-as-thing,” a defini- tion that treats the tangible objects in museum or personal collections as in­ formation.1[LIS] ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkrtj7k62zq5npst3rqhhzt3))
    - Note: See notes on Buckland 1991
- In contrast, the informatics or computer science perspective takes an abstract view of “docu­ ment” to refer to any self-contained unit of information, separating a docu­ ment's content from its presentation or container.2[Com] ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkrtpx5gjnwm4mg0f91chtkh))
- Astute readers might have noticed that we included sensor data as “infor­ mation about physical things” and data feeds as “information about digital things.” Many textbooks in the information science and knowledge manage­ ment fields distinguish data and information in a more precise way. To them, data sits at the bottom of an Information Hierarchy, Knowledge Pyramid, or DIKW Hierarchy in which Data is transformed into Information, which is transformed into Knowledge, which is then transformed into Wisdom.

- . The latest additions to the discipline of or­ ganizing are coming from data science and machine learning, introducing con­ siderations of speed and scale that arise when massive computational power and new statistical techniques are harnessed to organize and act on informa­ tion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0jx5c72p20nbzj38z2d7pq))
- For example, library and information science has traditionally studied organizing from a public sector bibliographic perspec­ tive, paying careful attention to user requirements for access and preserva­ tion, and offering prescriptive methods and solutions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0jzjjbfwzrghw8911ydx8h))
- In contrast, com­ puter science and informatics tend to study organizing in the context of information-intensive business applications with a focus on process efficien­ cy, system architecture, and implementation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0k02tkxtkzef6jgpm8y1w3))
- The new methods and tools of data science and machine learning let us organ­ ize more information, to do it faster, and to make predictions based on what people have clicked on, bought, or said. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0k6fp1dmqma0p958x2xrr0))
- What about data science? Some data science involves collections of data that are “tall,” containing many millions or even billions of records that each have a relatively small number of variables. Being able to analyze “tall” data more rapidly than ever before is primarily a change in degree compared with traditional database techniques. Nevertheless, for collec­ tions of data that are “wide,” where each record might contain hundreds or thousands of variables, data science techniques might allow us to see pat­ terns that could not be seen at all, or could not be seen affordably and in quantity. Here, data science might be yielding changes in kind. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0kay2h1x0r6hx30d4pmhs3))
- For example, to understand seasonal buying pat­ terns, a retailer might combine shopping data with weather data and calendar data about commonly-watched sporting events (because bad weather and broadcast sports cause people to stay home), and all three datasets would need to describe “time” and “location” in the same way.

- Every Organizing System is biased by the perspectives and experiences of the people who create it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0kkayfqxq5p3vj9r9yj8v3))
- Some of these biases are inescapable, a kind of automatic organizing, because they reflect innate human perceptual and cognitive capabil­ ities. Our minds impose structure and find patterns, even when there aren’t any, and we are not capable of acting perfectly rationally, so we simplify without re­ alizing it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0kkxs192g6dgkta4rbjbq7))
- Other biases in Organizing Systems reflect more intentional choices that implicitly or explicitly create winners or losers, treat some interac­ tions as preferred while deprecating others, or otherwise impose or overlay a set of values on the stakeholders of the system. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0ks9xy7h8pace28cj4hkbc))
- Other words that aim for this broad scope are entity, object, item, and instance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0kx41dh1tnqa0dy0wxg9c6))
- Document is often used for an information resource in either digital or physical format; artifact refers to re­ sources created by people, and asset for resources with economic value. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0kxqxpynv7ndgpewk9ezes))
- an information resource in either digital or physical format; artifact refers to re­ sources created by people, and asset for resources with economic value. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0ky67t9t0nm33e2mea487g))
    - Note: but what is an information resource created by people with economic value?
- Instead of emphasizing the differences between tangible and intangible resour­ ces, we consider it essential to determine whether the tangible resource has in­ formation content—whether it needs to be treated as being “about” or repre­ senting some other resource rather than being treated as a thing in itself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0m1qmxj9k9nvvah28zprrq))
- (Of course, there is no sharp boundary here; you can buy “fashion hangers” that make a style statement, and the old measur­ ing cup could be a family me­ mento because it belonged to Grandma). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0m31td0cqty015t684ban2))
    - Note: information is situational
- Resources that describe, or are associated with other resources are sometimes called metadata. However, when we look more broadly at Organizing Systems, it is often difficult to distinguish between the resource being described and any description of it or associated with it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn0m5je7fj7v673xdnbtv6ha))
    - Note: When is data data and metadata metadata? when is metadata data?
