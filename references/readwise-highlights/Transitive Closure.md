## Highlights
- In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), the **transitive closure** *R*+ of a [homogeneous binary relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_binary_relation) R on a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)) X is the smallest [relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_(mathematics)) on X that contains R and is [transitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation). For finite sets, "smallest" can be taken in its usual sense, of having the fewest related pairs; for infinite sets *R*+ is the unique [minimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_element) transitive [superset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superset) of *R*.

- For example, if X is a set of airports and x R y means "there is a direct flight from airport x to airport y" (for x and y in X), then the transitive closure of R on X is the relation *R*+ such that *x* *R*+ *y* means "it is possible to fly from x to y in one or more flights".
